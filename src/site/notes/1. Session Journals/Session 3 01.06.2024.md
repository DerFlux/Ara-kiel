Half year timeskip Freya turns from Feywild warlock to undead warlock

While riding back from [[2. Locations/Sword coast/Cragmaw Castle\|Cragmaw Castle]] we arrive at a forest.

We fought a lot of bat like monsters.
Then advanced and fought a lot of Skeletons, then a weird slime.
[[4. Player characters/Freya Mythcrya\|Freya Mythcrya]] unlocked a safe perfectly.

We fought a spectator, got a weird energy thing to give us +1 on one item for 12 hours. [[4. Player characters/Amantha the First\|Amantha the First]] took it.

Took care of some bugbears.

Got ambushed by a bunch of ~~Spiders~~ Sheep.

After short resting, the [[Black Spider\|Black Spider]] came to bargain. We were trying to bargain with him first, before we decided to catch him off guard, by closing the door, discussing stuff and then opening it with our readied spells.
I killed the Black spider guy in one hit via Witch Bolt.

We celebrated in Phandalin my ~~cult members~~ fans came by and we drank a lot
