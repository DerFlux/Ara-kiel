We were ambushed by goblins and 3 goblin archer. Velvet came in to help us

One of the goblins had a cloak which is good for stealth ([[4. Player characters/Amantha the First\|Amantha the First]] has it currently)
(Attuning to it takes a short rest)

[[4. Player characters/Velvet Crowe\|Velvet Crowe]] (Patrick's Character joined us) after helping us in the ambush.

The Druid comes back and we go to the town [[2. Locations/Sword coast/Waterdeep\|Waterdeep]] via carriage.

Chilled around at waterdeep until we went to [[2. Locations/Sword coast/Cragmaw Castle\|Cragmaw Castle]]...

Ran into Bandits on the way, annihilated them. Also a fucking mind flayer appeared, hollow purpled it (Witch bolt)

Fucking nearly died at Craigmore castle
