Went to the market to get some disguise kits.

[[3. NPC's/Avalon/Jay\|Jay]] approached us recently, saying he was our escort to go to [[2. Locations/Astra/The Northern Lands/Kingdom of Midgard/Kingdom of Midgard\|Kingdom of Midgard]].

Later on, on the sea we were called to the captain's quarters in the ship.
Jay was there as well

We got a company license at [[2. Locations/Astra/The Northern Lands/Kingdom of Midgard/Asphodel\|Asphodel]] for the Northern Lands to work as a bakery

The knights of [[2. Locations/Astra/The Northern Lands/Kingdom of Midgard/Kingdom of Midgard\|Midgard]] have found some magical way to empower themselves
