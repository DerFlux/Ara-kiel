[[4. Player characters/Velvet Crowe\|Velvet Crowe]] fishes [[3. NPC's/Limurea/Dredge\|Dredge]]'s pet [[3. NPC's/Limurea/Jeff\|Jeff]]

We are invited to a tournament by [[3. NPC's/Limurea/Lora Lemer\|Lora Lemer]]. There are more people than usual in the hawaii tournament.

Freya and Mara cooked a succulent meal together for the party and Lora, while being at her abode. Accidentally touching hands and well, talking and laughing while cooking

Much later lots of gay moments ensued between the 3 of them. Freya watching, Lara on top, Mara bottom

Fought a lvl 1 party in round 1, Velvet knocked out 3 of em in one turn.

Round 2 we fought the troll Jeb and his friends. Jeb apparently cooks cookies for kids and is homeless by choice. (Lives under the town's bridge) [[4. Player characters/Mara Malinovinoch\|Mara Malinovinoch]] critically kamehameha'd Jeb

Round 3 we fought [[3. NPC's/Limurea/Lora Lemer\|Lora Lemer]], 2 sharks and Jeff. Jeff ulted [[4. Player characters/Freya Mythcrya\|Freya Mythcrya]] and Velvet and both of them got thrown into the water.  Jeff escaped after that. Freya got ganked up on both sharks and nearly died while drowning (She will begin learning to swim after that traumatic event) Mara was able to barely save her with a healing spell after only having 1 round of holding her breath left

Round 4 We started fighting [[3. NPC's/Avalon/Salum\|Salum]] who had another clone while fighting us, which disappeared/turned invisible in their round

We won around 67 gold and 5 Silver each.
