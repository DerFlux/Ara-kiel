Setting up something big related to the prison.

The stellar team made a b line straight to Hela.

They saw someone resembling Mira being loaded into the ship a few weeks ago.

We were ambushed by [[3. NPC's/Thespians/Thespians\|Thespian]] Midgard knights and casters

Mara used an anime like attack with her scythe Striking 3 of them

We took care of the rest with Mara and Freya barely survived.

As we ran and tried to escape from the city we ran into the divine destiny's group.

We  took a detour and ran to get our carriage.

Later on Mara found 6 platinum from one of the Thespian priestesses and shared 3 with Freya to get them back on what they paid for the parking ticket.


There was a blockage.
Freya and Mara worked together to use a flashbang/light stone (Telekinetic Projectile + Light)

Amantha the fourth was navigating the carriage and rolled a nat 20 to tumble through the whole blockade of 3 people.
