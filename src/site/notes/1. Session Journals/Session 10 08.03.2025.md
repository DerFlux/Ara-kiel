Met the [[3. NPCs/Avalon/Atlas, The Barron\|Unknown contact's]] spy [[3. NPCs/Avalon/Loid\|Loid]] who's  an automaton, who came to our camp

He picked up [[Kevin\|Kevin]] and is proven to be trustworthy

We made our way to [[2. Locations/Astra/The Northern Lands/Kingdom of Midgard/Vana\|Vana]] in the next morning after.

The local nobility is going to be holding a ball soon.

[[3. NPCs/Avalon/Yao\|Yao]] brought us dresses to go to that ball

Freya got this dress

[[4. Player characters/Velvet Crowe\|Velvet]] got this dress

The general [[Autorius\|Autorius]] will be revealing something big soon

We bake for the nobles, but (rolled badly) with Mara due to stress and other factors and knowing that [[3. NPCs/Thespians/Thespians\|Thespians]] seem to be everywhere and the juju's of the feeling of her god's power being suppressed due to a totem nearby. The bread doesn't satisfy the nobles, compared to all the times it satisfied the peasents.

Using [[3. NPCs/Familiars/Ouroboros\|Ouroboros]] Freya investigated and sneaked her way through the ball, finding an eerie door. Within the door are human sacrifices, and a rift of the Thespian dimension above. The energy there within gives Mara most Juju's. Freya would take pictures of these things as evidence for [[2. Locations/Avalon/Avalon (Between Astra & Terra)\|Avalon]].

Meanwhile at the same time, Mara, Velvet and Amantha notice the arrival of [[3. NPCs/Thespians/Cartha Coccineus, the Scarlet Priestess\|Cartha Coccineus, the Scarlet Priestess]]. Calling out to Mara to force her to come over. While in her disguise Mara approaches her. 

Cartha asks about the baker, who was being Mara who was in disguise. Asking if that was her cooking skill and that it was disgusting, but they will be spared for today. She told Mara to leave with her other bakers (us) and that our services won't be needed anymore.

Mara, Velvet and Amantha would then secretly take pictures of the nobles coveting with the Thespians and Cartha being there and brainwashing said nobles.
