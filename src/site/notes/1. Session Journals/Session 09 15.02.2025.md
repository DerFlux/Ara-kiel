Met a farmer woman who's looking for her lost child Kevin

[[Autorius\|Autorius]] took over as the captain of the Knights of Midgard a long time ago.

Kevin's friends lead us to a forest where we tracked his footprints and then suddenly came across weird prints we've never seen before. The kids left before that We came across some weird monsters 

We faced some [Barghest](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=2846)  as a red-haring, as we thought that, they were the reason [[Kevin\|Kevin]] got caught. Freya got cursed by one of the Barghest and wasn't able to be healed by spells or potions anymore.

After we beat them, we got 2 Shadow Signets. [[4. Player characters/Freya Mythcrya\|Freya]] and [[4. Player characters/Mara Malinovinoch\|Mara]] took those items.

We soon followed some more tracks and ended up finding [[3. NPC's/Thespians/Adlibs\|Adlibs]] and a [[3. NPC's/Thespians/Quovadis\|Quovadis]] [[3. NPC's/Thespians/Thespians\|Thespian]] and fought them. After we won and beat the Quovadis in a non-lethal way she turned into a young farm girl. 

We ended up finding Kevin in the cave past, half turned into a [[3. NPC's/Thespians/Thespians\|Thespian]] already. Mara would use several spells like cleanse affliction, cleanse mind and similar. Freya would use the pocket library spell to find out anything about it, [[4. Player characters/Amantha the Fourth\|Amantha]] would try to heal the kid and [[4. Player characters/Velvet Crowe\|Velvet]] would consult her [[3. NPC's/Thespians/Quaeritas the claw of despair\|arm]]. 

The arm would tell her that it's the same transformation that she went through. The thing is though, that the child's mind is still intact. No Thespian is actually inside the child, like with Velvet. 

Mara messaged the [[3. NPC's/Avalon/Atlas, The Barron\|Unknown Contact]] for help. We will be meeting up with them at our camp to save the child.

We met up with the rest of the party at the camp.
