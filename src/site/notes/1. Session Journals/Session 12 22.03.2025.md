On our way to the capital of Midgard, [[2. Locations/Astra/The Northern Lands/Kingdom of Midgard/Asheim\|Asheim]] lvl 15.

The city consists of the lower city (Peasent area) and the higher city (Nobles)

We got to the city the festival of prosperity is taking place. We got a stand for our cooking area.  Mara feels her connection to her god weaken even more than before back in [[2. Locations/Astra/The Northern Lands/Kingdom of Midgard/Vana\|Vana]].

We got to an inn and got a standard room (not suite) and the arrangements were 2 big beds.

[[4. Player characters/Mara Malinovinoch\|Mara Malinovinoch]] with a big grin announced that she's fine with sleeping with anyone. After a small argument about how the arrangement should be done, Freya embarrassed grabbed onto Mara, used [Time Jump](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1019) and moved them both to a bed.

[[4. Player characters/Velvet Crowe\|Velvet Crowe]] teased [[4. Player characters/Freya Mythcrya\|Freya Mythcrya]] about it, so did [[3. NPCs/Familiars/Ouroboros\|Ouroboros]].

Mara whispered into Freya's ear stating that they are going to have so much fun~
Freya spilled the tea from her mouth afterwards due to it.

Afterwards we explored the city to find the "juju". Every time we saw a religious statue or similar worshiping [[2. Locations/Astra/The Northern Lands/Kingdom of Midgard/Kingdom of Midgard\|Midgard]]'s deity the juju's got worse.

When we wanted to go to the noble area (The higher city), guards blocked our way.

The juju's get worse in the church in the lower city, but not as bad compared to the totem in the castle where [[3. NPCs/Thespians/Cartha Coccineus, the Scarlet Priestess\|Cartha Coccineus, the Scarlet Priestess]] was. 

Velvet asked the priest about the god that they worship in Midgard

The festival of prosperity is taking place and has only been created because they wanted to reveal something.  (General [[Autorius\|Autorius]] revealing something) 

Traitors of [[2. Locations/Astra/The Northern Lands/Argent/Argent\|Argent]]

Beasts of [[2. Locations/Astra/The Northern Lands/Leones/Leones\|Leones]]

Some other spies got caught and we fought Midgard warriors and priestesses who turned out to be [[3. NPCs/Thespians/Adlibs\|Adlibs]] and [[3. NPCs/Thespians/Quovadis\|Quovadis]].

These were the team-mates (The blossom blizards/[[3. NPCs/Sakura Fubuki\|Sakura Fubuki]])
