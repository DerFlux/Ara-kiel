We'd create a makeshift camp with the other group. 

[[3. NPCs/Avalon/Carole Argent\|Carole]] discussed the alchemy bottles she had on the table, due to [[4. Player characters/Freya Mythcrya\|Freya]] asking and approaching her about it.

For testing purposes Freya decided to take the blue bottle and drink it. Turns out she got diarrhea. [[4. Player characters/Mara Malinovinoch\|Mara]] ended up casting cleanse affliction to help her not shit herself.

Freya would later on asks if the other group needs help with repairing their gear.

[[3. NPCs/Avalon/Orihime Tsubasa\|Orihime Tsubasa]] would reply that there's no need as the katana's haven't been used.
As Freya checked them, they seemed spotless. Curiosity overtaking her, she took one of the katana's and tried to mimic the movements [[3. NPCs/Avalon/Okami Ryuske\|Okami Ryuske]] and [[4. Player characters/Mara Malinovinoch\|Mara Malinovinoch]] did in the last battle.

She ends up failing miserably and falling face first into the dirt. She doesn't get up out of embarrassment.  Mara ends up helping her get up. She then dashes back into her tent. 

After they got to the Secret location from [[2. Locations/Astra/The Northern Lands/Kingdom of Midgard/Arcadia\|Arcadia]] in [[2. Locations/Astra/The Northern Lands/Kingdom of Midgard/The Forest\|The Forest]] everyone made themselves some drinks. [[4. Player characters/Amantha the Fourth\|Amantha]] made a drink for herself and offered Freya one.

She took it and well, she ended up not taking it well due to her being a lightweight. She got Enfeebled. [[3. NPCs/Avalon/Carole Argent\|Carole]] gave her smelling salts she created, taking her aback and helping her recover. 

-------------------------------------

We went into [[Kevin\|Kevin]]'s mindspace to cleanse him of his affliction by using [Mindscape Door](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rituals.aspx?ID=92). We went into his mind and saw an [[3. NPCs/Thespians/Adlibs\|Adlib]] [[3. NPCs/Thespians/Thespians\|Thespian]]. We took care of it in 1.5 seconds (In 1 round. After Mara and [[4. Player characters/Amantha the Fourth\|Amantha]] acted).

Next we went to enter the the girls mindscape. We beat a [[3. NPCs/Thespians/Quovadis\|Quovadis]] in around 2.5 seconds.

Then we went into [[4. Player characters/Amantha the First\|Amantha the First]]'s mindscape. Before we could [[3. NPCs/Thespians/Cartha Coccineus, the Scarlet Priestess\|Cartha Coccineus, the Scarlet Priestess]] would emerge. Taunting the group, planing this very act to find her way into the secret location into the forest. Carole, [[3. NPCs/Avalon/Okami Ryuske\|Okami Ryuske]], [[3. NPCs/Avalon/Atlas, The Barron\|Atlas, The Barron]] and [[3. NPCs/Avalon/Phoebe\|Phoebe]], would jump Cartha, with Carole teleporting them somewhere else. 

The [[3. NPCs/Avalon/Unholy Witches\|Unholy Witches]] would face Amantha the first again. Later on in the fight Mara would find an opening and slash her with holy damage. As Amantha the first turned bloody, she deflected the other attack from Mara's scythe and pushed everyone back. Her spear glowed velvet red until it developed into chains, wrapping around her body. 2nd phase

Amantha aids [[4. Player characters/Velvet Crowe\|Velvet Crowe]] in the final slash, by shooting an arrow on her knee with Amantha the first going down, perfectly for Velvet to decapitate her in the dreamscape.

Afterwards we get out of the dreamscape, Amantha the first is unconscious.

Cartha, Phoebie, Atlas and Ryuske reappear, being bloodied and somewhat standing after their fight with Cartha. After questioning them, it turns out their battle with Cartha was a winning battle with both parties fighting neck on neck until [[3. NPCs/Thespians/Albert, the Jester\|Albert, the Jester]] decided to appear.

Tactically retreating they teleported back to the hideout.

Outside the hideout a bunch of ad libs, comedy and tragedy would swarm the hideout, the arcane casters, [[3. NPCs/Avalon/Hikoboshi Koi\|Hikoboshi Koi]] and [[3. NPCs/Avalon/Elanor De Fleur\|Elanor De Fleur]] and Tsubasa fighting the horde. Velvet ran outside first helping them as we questioned the other group.

We'd rush in later helping them, exhausted we continued to fight until we finished up clearing everyone.

After we rest up at the makeshift camp, Elanour and Freya would fight, as everyone asked if someone prepared [Prestidigitation](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1639&Redirected=1). Nobody having it prepared, Elanour says that she has her maids usually deal with this, so she never has it prepared. Freya would say: "Well I can't see any maids here so." Elanor: "Well I see one right in front of me" referring to Freya.

Carole would diffuse the situation afterwards.
 
Later on Mara figures out that she's a kitsune after asking Ryuske who's also one. Apparently there's a pressure point, which Tsubasa presses, which makes Mara turn into a full-fleged kitsune instead of a half-Kitsune like her usual transformations.

Freya would sneak up on Mara to hug her fluffy tail, putting her face on it as she happily enjoyed the warm fluff. The workaholic, sleepless Witch loving it. At some point, Mara would moan making Freya and Mara embarrassed and Freya step back once.
