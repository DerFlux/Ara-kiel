We crossed the border to Leones and got to Borea. [[Images/Cyrius\|Cyrius]] meets up with us at the gate of Leones together with [[Images/Roland\|Roland]] of the [[Phoenix Guard\|Phoenix Guard]]

Royal highness likes [[4. Player characters/Amantha the Fourth\|Amantha]] and [[4. Player characters/Velvet Crowe\|Velvet]] for greeting her casually. The other parties including [[4. Player characters/Freya Mythcrya\|Freya]] and [[4. Player characters/Mara Malinovinoch\|Mara]] tried to stay in decorum

We made it into the prison but as we were on the ship we notice a [[3. NPC's/Thespians/Thespians\|Thespian]] portal above the prison.

As [[3. NPC's/Avalon/Carole Argent\|carole]], [[3. NPC's/Avalon/Atlas, The Barron\|Atlas]] and the others parties ([[3. NPC's/Avalon/The Divine Destinies\|1]]. [[3. NPC's/Sakura Fubuki\|2]]. [[Stellar Stellar\|3]].) and Leones distracted from the sides via canon fires, we'd enter in a straight line. 

We fought fiends, and then rescued a pirate who said that deeper down his pirate captain was sealed ahead 
As we proceeded entered in diabolic a door stays "Forfit you life if you wish to enter" which Freya translated. 

We continued on and in a huge cage fight like environment, we'd a bunch of Babau (fiends) and a Onidoshi and the pirate captain.

[[Barbatos\|The pirate captain]] was fighting the Onidoshi bare handed.
