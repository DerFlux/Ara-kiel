We baked for the first day afterwards.

We checked if there's anything wrong with the girl. Apparently there is an [[3. NPC's/Thespians/Thespians\|aberration]] in her mind

The unknown contact slid a paper down indicating this

-------------------------------------------------------
Dearest [[3. NPC's/Avalon/Unholy Witches\|(Un) Holy Witches]],  
Your sending stones might be bugged. Destroy them ASAP. If you're planning to leave the city, move east. Someone will be waiting to meet you on the way.   
Sincerely.  
- [[3. NPC's/Avalon/Atlas, The Barron\|Your Contact]]
--------------------------------------------
We put our sending stones into the bag of holding.

Wanting Orobouros to scout she had to make a deal with him that she#ll hunt an owl bear and give him an egg to eat.
We'd let [[3. NPC's/Familiars/Ouroboros\|Ouroboros]] scout spamming [[4. Player characters/Freya Mythcrya\|Freya]] with the spell Message giving her a migraine as he constantly told her what he saw.  (Trees. I see more Trees. Squirrel. IÂ caught a mouse. I was hongry. Gimme a few, I lost track of which direction I was meant to go. Ma'am, I don't know who you are or how you know who I am. I'm having an intellectual conversation with someone rn)

We met creator of [[3. NPC's/Avalon/Loid\|Loid]], [[3. NPC's/Avalon/Ophi\|Ophi]]. We put our sending stones into the arcane wooden box. Freya cast Watcher on the wall on it to keep track of what will happen with the box to see and listen.

We then met [[3. NPC's/Avalon/Atlas, The Barron\|Atlas, The Barron]] in their secret location, [[2. Locations/Astra/The Northern Lands/Kingdom of Midgard/Arcadia\|Arcadia]] who was our unknown contact We got some magical items.

The technicians of [[2. Locations/Astra/The Northern Lands/Argent/Argent\|Argent]] got the blueprints for the sending stones from Atlas. So we got new sending stones.

The faction is known as Arcadia
