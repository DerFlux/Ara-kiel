Freya played magic the gathering with the others.

Learned it due to a nat 20 instantly. Jokes of her spectating others playing back in the library or accidentally studying it. Blue/Black.

Atlas contacted us to go to Leones. Meaning we had to be on our way to Borea
Additional note: They are definitely after you. 

If we keep going to the nearest border from the thieves guild/shop/bar/restaurant, there will be people waiting for us. Bar has been compromised.

We ended up getting ambushed by [[3. NPCs/Thespians/Thespians\|Thespians]]. A quavadis, ad lib and a dragon.

Velvet got to a critical state (0hp) and [[3. NPCs/Thespians/Quaeritas the claw of despair\|Quaeritas the claw of despair]] came out and took control, fighting the dragon.
