The Scribes are Avalon's magical research faction. They specialise in development of more efficient magical tools and training of new mages. Among their responsibilities is also teaching, maintaining and developing the magic academy on the main island of Avalon. The Academy's Headmaster is known as a genius prodigal Sorceress, but also a no-nonsense leader. She's known to be rather cold hearted and ruthless.
