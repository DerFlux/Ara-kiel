Names carry power. The more well known a name the more power it has. Relics are powerful items often associated with figures of legend and derive their power from the respect their names demand. Weapons like Excalibur, Durendal and Ascalon are among the most well known Relics out there. The few capable of wielding them often have their names and stories forever engraved in the annals of history. Certain Relics have lost their names. They often hold power capable of toppling nations on their own and are sealed away in the most dangerous parts of the world. These Forgotten Relics are a priority for many major factions as getting hold of even one can completely shift the balance of power in this world.
