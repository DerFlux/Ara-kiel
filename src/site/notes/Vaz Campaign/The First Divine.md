Before there was time, before there was anything there was nothing. And before there was nothing there were monsters. In this pool of chaos and void of nothingness these monsters were known as Oleths*, destroying and killing one another indefinitely without a single conscious thought, though one of them gained consciousness, with her first conscious thought she brought together a barrier to separate herself from the Oleths. Her name was Lia’Ger’Ia*. Her first action was to create the gods that would at the time reign over the reality we now know today. The multiverse within the barrier we now inhabit and the world of Ara’Kiel was created by Lia’Ger’Ia and maintained by the gods she created.

Morteus was god of death, he reaps those who die and pass, he ends what must end and destroys what must no longer exist, commonly portrayed as a skeleton cladded in a black cloak wielding a gray scythe. Commonly worshipped by those who are close to death hoping for when he comes it is peaceful and they get to pass, or those who enjoy bringing death to others.

Mindis was known for his everlasting pursuit of knowledge and the arcane, he was a god like no other, he takes no ordinary shape and more so his body appears to be an impossible structure, impossible to replicate yet those who have seen his visage have been driven mad by its very existence. He is worshipped by scholars who seek to learn more of this world.

Belial the honourable, also known as the unyielding was a god of primal power, commonly associated with beasts and monsters his visage takes on that of the tarrasque who is believed to be a creation of his visage. He is a mighty beast or man depending on what avatar of his one is to meet but in all depictions of him, he does not harm those who can not protect themselves nor does he cause unnecessary bloodshed. He is not cruel, he is a warrior not a plunderer. His worshippers are knights and adventurers who enjoy the thrill of battle.

Owaris the champion of cheer, also known as the God of man, they are commonly seen in the visage of a beautiful man or woman. Their eloquent speech and displays of kindness are like no other, if someone starves around them Owaris will go out of their way to feed them, if someone is sick Owaris will go out of their way to heal them. Owaris is commonly worshipped by beggars and those of poor health for they hope to encounter his love one day. In addition Bards and Writers adore him for his own contribution to art.

Povert the harbinger of pain and strife. He is a god who lavishes causing harm, he brings nothing but pain yet he calls himself a god of truths, he may be right, yet there is little to say about him besides when you see the moon grin at you, you must avert your gaze no matter what. He is worshipped by the most vile and heinous individuals known to date. Those who worship him participate in murder rituals and suicide festivals, if you ever see men or women with scars of the moon upon their flesh do not let them close to yourself or your family.

Stella, the one that gave continuity before her time, was not a concept. Stella was a kind goddess, one that brought the world together, her body was like the night sky, her eyes were like the sun and moon themselves. Her consciousness pushed time ever onward, her flesh bound space together. It is believed that the sun and moon that are her eyes are not those of our world, we believe they are of our twin world known as Pere’Dea*. Which I intend to explore one day. Commonly worshipped by those who study the laws of the world, druids and the like.

Ozimandias was chance itself, where fate has no say he does. When a gambler calls the right coin he is blessed by Ozimandias. Known as the king of the lucky and tyrant of the unlucky. His role was simple, to help steady fate. Without him the multiverse would fall in disarray just like without any other god. Adventurers flock to him for what is a better thing to have when you are in peril than good luck itself.


These gods that reigned over us for a while are nothing but now a long forgotten truth, it is said that mortals came to replace them countless ages ago, yet I find it hard to believe considering the aspects these deities come to embody and the mere worship of them have never ceased to exist. As I myself still find solace in the pursuit of knowledge. Yet I can not dare say that these worries are unfounded, the world seems a lot quieter than the stories of the past tell us, were the gods a fable? Something to soothe our understanding of the world? Or were they perhaps usurped? Or worse yet abandoning us? 

We can not say for sure but a new school of faith has come about from these theories. We call it in this day and age “The Belief of New Gods”. Mortals that have come in direct contact with divinity and have taken it for themselves becoming either Husk* or Ascended*. These new gods embody the same concepts as the Old Gods, but all this information comes from reports given to us by Husks claiming to be tortured mortal souls with divine power causing pain and suffering yet they speak of the other new gods, they call them the ascended. They call them the true successors of the old gods. These ascended are slowly pushing our world in a new direction, the husks call it the age of separation, but we have yet to confirm if any of the husk’s words are true. Worship towards Husks has given semblances of divine power towards these worshippers, it is believed these husks are not too far from a god, maybe the only difference is the mindset they possess. Which poses a question, what separates a Husk and an Ascended, what trait is damning enough to torment your soul if you dare to try and become divine? 

The Husks so far have told us of these new Ascended Gods; Penelope the Goddess of Freedom, Leonardé the God of Duty, Abram the God of Order and Noctis the God of Trickery. Which does not answer whether the power of the other old gods is still up for grabs or not, yet when we asked the husks if that was possible, it attacked one of our scribes and devoured his flesh for simply mentioning the possibility of another ascension. Containment of a Husk has proven impossible even through the power of multiple clerics’ spells and the strongest of prisons.
